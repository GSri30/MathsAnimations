# Maths_animations
This repository consists of all the useful animations related to theorems and other stuff in maths (of 1st year). We are using a software called "manim" for this purpose.
You can follow the following link (3blue1brown 's youtube channel) to get an essence of how they are gonna look like (not exactly,but some what similar) refer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">here</a>

You can look into these animations by:
<ul>
  <li>Head over to location where that particular animation_name.py is present and select the scene you want to play</li>
  <li>Now execute by typing  manim animation_name.py scene_name -pl (to preview low)    
                             manim animation_name.py scene_name -p (to preview in high)</li>
</ul>
Hope you get something out of it..
